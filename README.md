# VENTTUP

This is a MVP, which demonstrates a backend API built with Express.js and a frontend built with Vite and React.

## Getting Started

Clone the Repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/pushpitjain2006/Venttup-Tracking-software--Updated-.git
```

Install Dependencies: Â  

Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

```bash
cd Venttup-Tracking-software--Updated-/Backend
npm install
cd ../Frontend
npm install
```


### Run the Backend:


First of all setup the .env file 
- Go to /Backend
- Make a new file .env
- Copy contents from .env.example and make changes according to you.

Start the Express.js server with:
```bash
node ./app.js
```

This will typically run the server on port 3000 (default for Express.js). You can access the API at http://localhost:3000 (or adjust the port if configured differently).

Run the Frontend:

Start the Vite development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the React application in development mode, usually accessible at http://localhost:5173 (default for Vite). You can find the exact URL in your terminal output.
